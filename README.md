# Introduction

Hey, I am Giovanni! A software development who loves writing code, art and playing with its cat Elon.

## Reasoning

I am rebuilding my previous website built on top of gatsby because, well time has change, that was website was built on 2019 and a lot has passed since then. I got the source code on bitbucket privately since I didn't want to share any errors I might have, but may mentallity has change and I want to give a little bit of what the OSS community has given. I hope to that happens with this project.

## Tech Stack

I will be using:

- Remix 🚀 - Typescript
- Three.js
- React three fiber
- And possibly Tailwind.
